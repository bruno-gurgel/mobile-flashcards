# Mobile Flashcards

This project was made during [Udacity's React Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019) and it's a a mobile application (only tested in IOS) that allows users to study collections of flashcards.

The app will allow users to create different categories of flashcards called "decks", add flashcards to those decks, then take quizzes on those decks.

## **IMPORTANT: This project was only tested in IOS!**

## Technologies used

[React Native](https://reactnative.dev/), [Expo](https://docs.expo.io/) & [React-Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/)

## Starting the App

-   Install all the dependencies with `npm install` | `yarn install`;
-   Start the development server with `npm start` | `yarn start`;

**Obs: Since this app was created with the newly released npm version 7, it creates a package-lock.json version 2, which may cause some problems if you don't have this npm version. In this case, you should install and start the app with yarn install and yarn start. [Here are the instructions to install yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install/).**

**ObsÂ²: With NPM version 7, they introduced [Peer dependencies](https://github.blog/2021-02-02-npm-7-is-now-generally-available/#peer-dependencies). And some packages have not released versions that are made for React 17 (or another new package), but that doesn't mean that those packages don't work. If you face this issue, you can use --force, or --legacy-peer-deps, [here is a more detailed explanation](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/66020820/npm-when-to-use-force-and-legacy-peer-deps/66035709).**
